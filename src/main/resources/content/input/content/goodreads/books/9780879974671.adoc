<div class="book-description">
Marooned on the strange planet Tschai, Adam Reith agreed to lead an expedition to return the princess Ylin Ylan, the Flower of Cath, to her homeland halfway around the globe.<br /><br />Monsters of land and sea lay before them, and beings both human and alien who might rob, kill or enslave them. Tschai was a large planet, an ancient planet, where four powerful alien races struggled for mastery while humans were treated as pawns; nothing would be easy for Reith on this journey. But the girl's father was enormously wealthy and her homeland technologically sophisticated.<br /><br />If Reith was ever to obtain human aid in returning to Earth, where better than Cath? If he could get there...<br /><br />SERVANTS OF THE WANKH, complete in itself, is the second volume of Jack Vance's masterwork interplanetary saga.

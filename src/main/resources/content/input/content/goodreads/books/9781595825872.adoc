<div class="book-description">
Dinosaurs. Seriously, can the frantic world of Gantz get any more scary? How about a giant doughboy with crazy fangs and a strange outie bellybutton? Yeah, it's not just scary; it's a very strange world for Kei!. At least this time the Gantz crew have a new weapon! It's an awesome state-of-the-art uni-motorcycle thing! And one of the characters uses a massive space samurai sword. It's Gantz!<br /><br />Each volume of Gantz comes shrink-wrapped and carries an 18+ content advisory.

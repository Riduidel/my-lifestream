<div class="book-description">
A gang of vampire guys . . . who can grow samurai swords from their very flesh! Once again, Hiroya Oku is pushing the envelope with his crazy manga Gantz!<br /><br />And to add to it, these vampire yakuza guys might not even be aliens! This isn't a mission. These guys seem to know who is working for Gantz, and are coming after them. On the streets where they work and live. In the daylight. All of a sudden the wall between everyday humanity and Gantz's nighttime, extradimensional hunts is crumbling. What will Kei and the others do? Can they regenerate when they're injured outside of a mission? Find out!<br /><br />Each volume of Gantz comes shrink-wrapped and carries an 18+ content advisory.

Sérieusement ?<br/>Après les dinosaures,<br/>Après les statues boudhistes,<br/>des vampires ?<br/>L'auteur est quand même sérieusement allumé.<br/>Mais, à part son goût malsain pour les psychopathes, c'est assez drôle (même si complètement malsain).

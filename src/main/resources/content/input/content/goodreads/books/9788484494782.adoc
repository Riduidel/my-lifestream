<div class="book-description">
Plots are starting to twist in the Gantz storyline Has Kato disappeared forever? Who is this cute girl Kei's falling in love with? Does someone on the Internet know the secret of Gantz? And who is this huge fighter roaming the streets of Japan looking for the greatest fighting challenge? Well, the challenge he's looking for might come from the least likely of physical specimens. So far, the story of Gantz knows few bounds when it comes to plot twists and a constantly changing cast. When it's kill or be killed against a universe full of odd and resilient aliens, a lot of characters get killed off quickly. So far the most constant, and consistently evolving, character is Kei, a classic antihero. The question begins to set in... if Kei succeeds in fulfilling his contract with Gantz, will he be willing to give up these superhuman powers he's begun to take for granted?

Un curieux tome de transition, dans lequel notre héros ne se battra contre personne (dommage), et qui nous permettra de découvrir d'autres personnages, tous aussi curieux qu'intriguants.<br/>Cela dit, les tomes de transition, je trouve toujours ça pénible.

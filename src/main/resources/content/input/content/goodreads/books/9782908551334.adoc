<div class="book-description">
A set of tales inspired by 1001 Arabian Nights, European comics master Sergio Toppi’s Sharaz-de explores a barbaric society where the supernatural is the only remedy to injustice.<br /> <br />The lovely Sharaz-de, captive to a cruel and despotic king, must each night spin tales to entertain her master and save her head from the executioner. Her tales are filled with evil spirits, treasures, risk, and danger, but ever at their center hold the passions of gods and men.
